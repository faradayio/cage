# If several of your images share a single library, you can use this file
# to specify where the source code for those libraries can be found.

# Each entry takes the form:
#
#     <KEY>: <GIT URL>

# To specify that a container should mount the checked-out code as a
# volume, you can use the key `io.fdy.cage.lib.<KEY>`.  See
# `pods/frontend.yml` for an example.
