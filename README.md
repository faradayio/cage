# Orchestrates `docker-compose` for large, multi-pod apps

**THIS PROJECT WILL BE RENAMED SHORTLY.**  Keep tuned; we'll have an actual
release fairly soon, with any luck.

[![Latest version](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/conductor.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/conductor) [![License](https://img.shields.io/crates/l/conductor.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/faradayio/conductor.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/faradayio/conductor)

This is a work in progress using the
[`compose_yml`](https://github.com/emk/compose_yml) library.  It's
a reimplementation of our internal, _ad hoc_ tools using the new
`docker-compose.yml` version 2 format and Rust.

[API Documentation](https://faradayio.github.io/conductor/)

## What's this for?

- Does your app include more than one `docker-compose.yml` file?
- Does your app contain a mixture of permanently running containers and
  one-shot tasks?
- Does your app run across more than one cluster of machines?
- Do individual components of your app need their own load balancers?
- When running in development mode, do you need to replace 3rd-party
  services with local containers?

If you answer to one or more of these questions is "yes", then `conductor`
is probably for you.  It provides development and deployment tools for
complex `docker-compose` apps, following
a [convention over configuration][coc] philosophy.

## Installation

To install, we recommend using `rustup` and `cargo`:

```sh
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
cargo install conductor
```

We also provide [official binary releases][releases] for Mac OS X and for
Linux.  The Linux binaries are statically linked using [musl-libc][]
and [rust-musl-builder][], so they should work on any Linux distribution,
including both regular distributions and stripped down distributions like
Alpine.  Just unzip the binaries and copy them to where you want them.

The Mac binaries are somewhat experimental because of issues with MacPorts
and OpenSSL.  If they fail to work, please file a bug and try installing
with `cargo`.

## Trying it out

Create a new application using conductor, and list the associated Git
repositories:

```sh
$ conductor new myapp
$ cd myapp
$ conductor repo list
rails_hello               https://github.com/faradayio/rails_hello.git
```

Check out the source code for an image locally:

```sh
$ conductor repo clone rails_hello
$ conductor repo list
rails_hello               https://github.com/faradayio/rails_hello.git
  Cloned at src/rails_hello
```

Start up your application:

```sh
$ conductor up
Starting myapp_db_1
Starting myapp_web_1
```

You'll notice that the `src/rails_hello` directory is mounted at
`/usr/src/app` inside the `myapp_web_1` pod, so that you can make changes
locally and test them.

Run a command inside the `frontend` pod's `web` container to create a
database:

```sh
$ conductor exec frontend web rake db:create
Created database 'myapp_development'
Created database 'db/test.sqlite3'
```

We can also package up frequently-used commands in their own, standalone
"task" pods, and run them on demand:

```sh
$ conductor run migrate
Creating myapp_migrate_1
Attaching to myapp_migrate_1
myapp_migrate_1 exited with code 0
```

You should be able to access your application at http://localhost:3000/.

You may also notice that since `myapp_migrate_1` is based on the same
underlying Git repository as `myapp_web_1`, that it also has a mount of
`src/rails_hello` in the appropriate location.  If you change the source on
your host system, it will automatically show up in both containers.

We can run container-specific unit tests, which are specified by the
container, so that you can invoke any unit test framework of your choice:

```sh
$ conductor test frontend web
```

And we can access individual containers using a configurable shell:

```sh
$ conductor shell frontend web
root@21bbbb41ad4a:/usr/src/app#
```

The top-level convenience commands like `test` and `shell` make it much
easier to perform standard development tasks without knowing how individual
containers work.

```

## What's a pod?

A "pod" is a tightly-linked group of containers that are always deployed
together.  Kubernetes [defines pods][pods] as:

> A pod (as in a pod of whales or pea pod) is a group of one or more
> containers (such as Docker containers), the shared storage for those
> containers, and options about how to run the containers. Pods are always
> co-located and co-scheduled, and run in a shared context. A pod models an
> application-specific “logical host” - it contains one or more application
> containers which are relatively tightly coupled — in a pre-container
> world, they would have executed on the same physical or virtual machine.

If you're using Amazon's ECS, a pod corresponds to an ECS "task" or
"service".  If you're using Docker Swarm, a pod corresponds to a single
`docker-compose.xml` file full of services that you always launch as a
single unit.

Pods typically talk to other pods using ordinary DNS lookups or service
discovery.  If a pod accepts outside network connections, it will often do
so via a load balancer.

## Development notes

Pull requests are welcome!  If you're not sure whether your idea would fit
into the project's vision, please feel free to file an issue and ask us.

### Setting up tools

When working on this code, we recommend installing the following support
tools:

```sh
cargo install rustfmt
cargo install cargo-watch
```

We also recommend installing nightly Rust, which produces better error
messages and supports extra warnings using [Clippy][]:

```sh
rustup update nightly
rustup override set nightly
```

If `nightly` produces build errors, you may need to update your compiler
and libraries to the latest versions:

```sh
rustup update nightly
cargo update
```

If that still doesn't work, try `stable`:

```sh
rustup override set stable
```

If you're using `nightly`, run the following in a terminal as you edit:

```sh
cargo watch "test --no-default-features --features unstable --color=always" \
    "build --no-default-features --features unstable --color=always"
```

If you're using `stable`, leave out `--no-default-features --features
unstable`:

```sh
cargo watch "test --color=always" "build --color=always"
```

Before committing your code, run:

```sh
cargo fmt
```

This will automatically reformat your code according to the project's
conventions.  We use Travis CI to verify that `cargo fmt` has been run and
that the project builds with no warnings.  If it fails, no worries—just go
ahead and fix your pull request, or ask us for help.

#### On macOS

When building you may get an error that `'openssl/ssl.hs' file not found`. You
need to set the following env vars:

```
export OPENSSL_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/local/opt/openssl/include
export DEP_OPENSSL_INCLUDE=/usr/local/opt/openssl/include
```

### Official releases

To make an official release, you need to be a maintainer, and you need to
have `cargo publish` permissions.  If this is the case, first edit
`Cargo.toml` to bump the version number, then regenerate `Cargo.lock`
using:

```sh
cargo build
```

Commit the release, using a commit message of the format:

```txt
v<VERSION>: <SUMMARY>

<RELEASE NOTES>
```

Then run:

```
git tag v$VERSION
git push; git push --tags
cargo publish
```

This will rebuild the official binaries using Travis CI, and upload a new version of
the crate to [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/conductor).
