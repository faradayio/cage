        To enable tests for a service, add a label with the test command.
        Assuming your service uses rspec, this might look like:

            myservice:
              labels:
                io.fdy.cage.test: "rspec"

        Run this test command using:

            cage test myservice

        To run only a subset of your tests, you can also pass a custom test
        command:

            cage test myservice rspec spec/my_new_feature_spec.rb
