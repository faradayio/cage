  To create a new project:

      cage new myproj

  From inside a project directory:

      cage pull                      # Download images for the a project
      cage up --init                 # Start the app, initializing the database
      cage status                    # Get an overview of the project

  Access your application at http://localhost:3000/.  To download and edit
  the source code for your application, run:

      cage source ls                 # List available service source code
      cage source mount rails_hello  # Clone source and configure mounts
      cage up                        # Restart any affected services
      cage status                    # See how things have changed

  Now create `src/rails_hello/public/index.html` and reload in your browser.

        To enable tests for a service, add a label with the test command.
        Assuming your service uses rspec, this might look like:

            myservice:
              labels:
                io.fdy.cage.test: "rspec"

        Run this test command using:

            cage test myservice

        To run only a subset of your tests, you can also pass a custom test
        command:

            cage test myservice rspec spec/my_new_feature_spec.rb
